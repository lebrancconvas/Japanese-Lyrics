## Lyric  
はじけりゃ Yea！　素直に Good！  
だからちょいと重いのは Boo！  
That's all right！  
それでも時代を極める　そうさボクらは　Super Boy！  
We are “COOL”  
やな事あってもどっかでカッコつける  
やるだけやるけどいいでしょ？  
夢だけ持ったっていいでしょ？  
No one can take away your dream  
  
You are my soul soul, shaker  
You've taken me on a ride  
Oh you you, only you  
Heve always been here by my side  
Crazy, crazy  
You're filling me with energy  
You are the wind  
A-RA-SHI, A-RA-SHI  
My dream  
  
集う雲　slowly flow  
shout out to the world  
hey we are the storm  
僕ら未だ　まだ見てる  
でっかい愛とか希望探してる  
everyday everybody  
the sky's the limit (yes the sky's the limit)  
いまこそ始めてみるしかない  
Let's get it on, Let's get it on yeah  
そう　始めてみればいいじゃない  
  
Step by step  
I'm gonna give it all I got  
And then I push a little harder  
Day by day  
I'm getting closer closer to my destiny  
It's waiting there for me  
Don't stop me now  
Don't stop me now  
You better get ready！  
  
You are my soul soul,shaker  
You've taken me on a ride  
Oh you you, only you  
Heve always been here by my side  
Crazy, crazy  
You're filling me with energy  
You are the wind  
A-RA-SHI, A-RA-SHI  
My dream  
  
激しい嵐　凄まじい騒ぎ  
駆け抜ければ　瞬く灯り (yeah)  
天を飛び交う 5clouds gonna  
Fly away  
  
Step by step  
I'm gonna give it all I got  
And then I push a little harder  
Day by day  
I'm getting closer closer to my destiny  
It's waiting there for me  
Don't stop me now  
Don't stop me now  
You better get ready！  
  
That's right！  
  
You are my soul soul, shaker  
You've taken me on a ride  
Oh you you, only you  
Heve always been here by my side  
Crazy, crazy  
You're filling me with energy  
You are the wind  
A-RA-SHI, A-RA-SHI  
  
You are my soul soul, shaker  
You've taken me on a ride  
Oh you you, only you  
Heve always been here by my side  
Crazy, crazy  
You're filling me with energy  
You are the wind  
A-RA-SHI, A-RA-SHI  
My dream
