## Lyric  
I could not look backyou'd gone away from me  
I flet my heartacheI was afraid of following you  
When I was looking the shadows on the wall  
(I) started running into the night to find the true in me  
  
In the crowded street  
You're standing all alone  
The shadow of the days hide your heart  
You are bringing down the heart of the night  
keeping everything off  
  
※As if something gonna force you  
Now you're running into the storm  
Can't you see I'm always on your mind  
Tell me why you leave me alone※  
  
When I was gonna be losing you on my mind  
found my heart in soil  
I'm looking back the days  
These are gonna break my heart  
But I can't never hold back  
  
All of you in my memory  
is still shining in my heart  
Now you're wearing the mysterious lights  
It keeps me sticking into my heart  
  
★My heart has been gonna die deep red with all of pain  
There's no one to cure my pain only with out you  
How I try to shoutHow I try to run  
There's nothing I can do  
The wall hiding my heart is never broken again  
How I try to break★  
  
(※くり返し)  
  
(★くり返し)  
  
Crt in deep red…
